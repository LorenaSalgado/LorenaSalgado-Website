        <div class="subheading mb-5">Education Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Lorena Salgado. I am a second year student at University of Riverside California majoring in education. Outside of studying and exams, I am often caught up on light reading or watching of my favorite series, Toilet Bound Hanako-Kun. Beside Manga and anime, I have a major interest and desire towards horror role-playing games, or known as horror RPG games. One of my favorite RPG games is IB, Mad Father, The Crooked Man, and many more! Though reading or horror games is not the only hobby that interests me, I enjoy drawing or doodling random characters from my favorite shows or creating my own with unique backstories and storylines. Beside my respect and learning of Japanese culture, watching documentaries from historical to psychological is another interest of mine. But, outside of the closed door, I have a small passion for cooking or watching recipes to one day experiment or try out. I was born in Mexico City but grew up all my life in the United States, Moreno Valley. I am the middle child of both my parents but the second to last youngest child in total. Throughout childhood, I have been told to have a creativity yet outstanding mindset or thought process in both school and out. Unlike many of my peers, I had little to no desire to climb the social ladder of advanced classes. Even if given the opportunity, I would have never survived. All my test scores and state’s exams have either landed a label of “below below basic” or “below basic.” Though these labels were harmful for not myself but my educational journey, I had never given into a false narrative of what I was capable of accomplishing. I will not lie, throughout almost half of my education journey, I was unable to test out of English Language Development (ELD). Year after year of failing, I kept pushing through until the second year of high school, the year I was finally tested out of the system. While being an ELD student, I was also placed into support classes for both english and math since my state exam kept reporting back into the below average of my class and peers. However, throughout the support class and ELD, I had found my calling in life. In my high school, Moreno Valley High School, they had offered a career pathway for all students for either business or education. I had thought of business but knew deep down that math was not or never my strong suit. So education became my first choice. Why? There were many reasons why. For starters, I was already teaching many of my friends math or chemistry whenever needed help. Many teachers had also praised me for my creativity and outstanding lesson plan throughout the program and even took ideas to be implanted into their classroom. These little sparkles converted into a passion of becoming a teacher. The sensation of helping another fellow student or classmate or watching their eyes sparkle from one of my many failed yet creativity lesson plans, was all I needed to apply as an education major.</p><br><br>

        To be honest, when first applying towards U.C.R, I had been rejected from the school which had crushed my hopes and dreams. Waiting on their waitlist had terrified me not knowing if testing out of ELD and support classes was enough. Thankfully, I was accepted into the school soon after many people declined their offer, opening a spot for me. I may have not been their first choice, but knowing they even had considered me was more than enough! Education was my goal and education was gonna be my final destination. I may not have much experience in the school, but remembering my teacher's reaction upon hearing my acceptance rate filled my eyes with tears along with my family. I was officially gonna be the first immigrated-first year generation from my family. With tears of joy, there were tears of sadness. Upon reviewing my scholarships there was a high chance of enough funds to cover my classes and books. Food or living arrangement was not an issue since I live nearby the campus but even with that cost out of the way, the dent did not decrease. Thankfully, the school was able to give me grants that do not need to be paid back but rather to ensure my education at U.C.R. While studying at U.C.R my issues have only grown because of being an immigrant with no papers. Throughout my first years, many opportunities had come my way only for them to dissolve in my hands. They were all for my peers and classmates who had papers. For most of my life, everything that was offered to me was only a dream, another world, where if I had papers or was born in America, I was able to be given the same opportunities as my other peers. I bring this up because even though my experience so far has been not the best, I still love my major of education. The lack of opportunities only make me want to be a teacher towards my future students about first year or not immigration students. Reassure them that with or without papers, they are able to live a happy and fulfilling life with the chance of going to college. Growing up in a public school, no one was able to give me a straightforward answer upon my future. All of my scholarships were only for citizens of America or programs that were already close. Even filling out my application, no one was able to give me a straightforward answer about who should or should not be on my papers. This had only killed my motivation along with my passion of becoming a teacher. However, I am proud to say that I am a second year student studying in education with friends that may be different majors but are able to give a hand out. Networking in education is difficult but connecting with classmates about similar yet different experiences is so eye opening to how badly the K-12 education system is.<br><br>

        But why education? Education is a field that is often looked down upon by many majors because of the low paying rate, dealing with parents, or being seen as a lazy job. To be truthful, teachers are one of the most hard working people in the world that are often overlooked. They have little to no control over what is allowed or not allowed to be taught in a classroom setting. Education is more than just looking after students, they are the people who lay the pathway for the future generations. The idea of setting a small pathway towards a better future is truly what fascinates me. I adore the idea of helping other people in a subject that I once hated. Growing up, history was my least favorite subject. I was always bored out of my mind learning about dead people past life. I had seen no purpose in learning why people who stood before us should be remembered when history has forgotten them, or so I thought. Throughout my years of support and ELD, the only class I had felt “normal” was actually history which felt amazing but looking back, history plays a major role in today's society especially within education. As a Education Major, the few courses I had taken focused on the historical background of the ideal of education since Manifest Destiny. Not only that but, how teaching history from one perspective is actually harmful than many have thought. The history I have been taught is actually harmful and very one sided. Not much of Mexican or Mexican-American history is taught in the K-12 system nor Native American and African American. This has only pushed me into the direction of wanting to teach students of their background as much as possible since schools are becoming stricter about what is appropriate or not for students to learn. History is also becoming more of a single narrative while trying to cover up the important details that have shaped American to the country many love and praise for. That is why education is highly important and the major I have chosen. Education is a battle that is nowhere yet to be near done or with enough change for students of all backgrounds. I am thankful yet sadden that not many schools do not offer Chino Studies nor African American Studies. They are one of the most valuable classes for any students to learn about their heritage and feel accepted. That is another reason why I want to be a teacher. I want all my students to love for who they are rather than a system wanting to destroy or tell them that their background and beliefs are wrong. No background or belief is superior to the other nor should be debated by a bunch of people that have little to no background or experience with the culture. Education may seem boring but offer many layers along with connections of people that either have little to no experience or have gone something similar to a person K-12. Education does not have to be a pathway for teachers but creating exams, working in school districts, and much more! But I want to be a teacher, a teacher for change.
